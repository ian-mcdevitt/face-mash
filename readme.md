<h1>Celebrity face mash</h1>
<i>Mostapha Rammo</i>
Replica of Mark Zuckerburgs's face-mash from *The Social Network*
I used a **python** script and the **Beautigul Soup** library to scrap images and name data from public websites such as Wikipedia
This script is included in the main directory as **wiki_scrapper.py**, it'll save the images in a ./imgs directory, I'll also be creating a seperate repo for this code with it's exclusive description.
