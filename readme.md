<h1>Celebrity face mash</h1>
<i>Mostapha Rammo</i>

Replica of Mark Zuckerburgs's face-mash from <i>The Social Network</i>

I used a <b>python</b> script and the <b>Beautigul Soup</b> library to scrap images and name data from public websites such as Wikipedia

This script is included in the main directory as <b>wiki_scrapper.py</b>, it'll save the images in a ./imgs directory, I'll also be creating a seperate repo for this code with it's exclusive description.
